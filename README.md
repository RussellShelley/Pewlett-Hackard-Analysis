## Overview

Pewlitt Hackard is a large company with many older employees that may soon be retiring. In preparation for a “silver tsunami” as many current employees leave we will be:
- Determing the number of retiring employees per title.This will be done by creating a "Retirement Titles" table that holds all the titles of current employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955
 
- Identifying employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, that will help with ramping up replacements skill sets. This will be done by creating a "mentorship-eligibility" table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

We will utilise the Entity Relationship Diagram already created from csv data files given.
